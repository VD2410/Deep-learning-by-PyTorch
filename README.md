# Deep-learning-by-PyTorch

## Part 1
Starting from a baseline architecture we provided, you will design an improved deep net architecture to classify (small) images into 100 categories. 

## Part 2

fine-tune a ResNet model pre-trained on ImageNet for classifying the
Caltech-UCSD Birds datasetâ€‹ . This dataset consists of 200 categories of birds, with 3000 images
in train and 3033 images in test
